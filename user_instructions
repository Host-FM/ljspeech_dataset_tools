Hi, these are some tools I created to create a ljspeech format dataset.

First install the pip packages.
Copy this and paste it into the terminal:

pip install -r requirements

Now you just have to put the files in the folder that's named:
            
put_audio_files_here

Then run the python scripts in this order:

1. converttowav
2. normalize
3. silence_trimmer
4. transcribe
5. make_dataset

If you want to create a training & validation dataset,
replace the last script with make_t&v_dataset.

Don't forget to install the pip packages.
