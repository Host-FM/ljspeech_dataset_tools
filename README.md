# ljspeech_dataset_tools
These are some python scripts that can help create LJSpeech format datasets. These scripts mainly use pydub and whisper for transcription.

I created these for the purpose of training FastSpeech2. But you can use these and modify them to your hearts content.
I may add more stuff later, so if you have any suggestions surely let me know. I think my gmail is hostfazalakbar@gmail.com
